Bob and Ben buy big bags. But, bad bats bite Ben.

Ben begs Bob. Bob bops bad bats. Big blue bus blares by.

Bun, bag, bat, Bob brings back. Ben beams bright.

Bobâ€™s big bun breaks. Ben bids Bob better bake.

Bold Ben boasts. Bob bakes best buns, but Ben bets.

Bob bakes. Ben bites. Bad burn! Ben bawls.

Ben bobs. Bob baits big bass. Big bass bolts!

Bob bolts, Ben bends. Bus brakes. Bob bumps Ben!

Ben bites back. Bob blurts. Both boys battle.

Bob blames Ben. Ben blames Bob. Big bother!

Bugs buzz by. Ben bats bugs. Bob backs off.

Bob buys blue bag. Ben buys brown bun.

Big bad bull bolts. Bob, Ben bolt back!

Ben burns bag. Bob brings big bowl.

Bob bails. Ben bores. Bright birds bring bliss.

Bob brings box. Ben bets big bucks.

Ben builds big barn. Bob bonds bricks.

Big bonfire blazes. Bob, Ben bake bread.

Best buds, Bob and Ben, bask blissfully.

Bob bows. Ben bows. Best buddies forever.
